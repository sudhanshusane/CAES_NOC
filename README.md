# CAES_NOC
NetworkOnChip Simulation Environment.

This project is a personal project that will be built parallely alongside the CAES Ducksim project. 
The CAES_NOC will have the same features as the DuckSim, but will be limited to the NoC only. 
It's an opportunity for me to code independently and experiment with different approaches to structuring the simulation environment.
